# curriculum

This project aims to solve the problem of proposing a new curriculum in computer science, to replace an old curriculum.

## Soon!

This app powers curriculum located [http://curriculum-clark-ngo.herokuapp.com] (Heroku Project URL)

## Getting Started

## Software requirements

- Rails 5.0.0 or higher

- Ruby 2.3.1 or higher

- PostgreSQL 9.3.11 or higher

## Create Account in GitHub and Heroku

<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>

<a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>

## Setup your development environment (Mac)

Download vagrant files here: <a href="https://github.com/FirehoseProject/firehose-vagrant-rails5/raw/master/tools/vagrant.zip?raw=true">vagrant.zip</a>

Save to your Desktop

Unzip the file, it will create a folder called vagrant on your Desktop. This is where all your web development environment will live.

## Install Tools for development environment (Mac)

Go to the VirtualBox Website, click the link to Download "OS X hosts". Open the dmg file that downloads, then double click on VirtualBox.pkg that pops up and follow the instructions (you're clicking continue most of the time). Once you go through that step close out the "VirtualBox" window.

Go to the <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html">Vagrant Download</a> Page, click Find the Mac OS X section and click "Universal (32 and 64-bit)". Run the file you downloaded and follow the instructions (you're clicking next most of the time)

## Turn on your Web Dev environment

```
cd ~/Desktop/vagrant
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

## Accounts SSH Key

Generate SSH Key
Inside the web development terminal window, where it says [Web Dev] in blue, run the following lines one by one. important note: the command has backticks (`) not single-quotes ('), either copy and paste the command or if you type it use the key to the left of the 1 to type the backtick in the first line:
```
eval `ssh-agent -s`
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "Firehose Vagrant" -N '' -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

## Configure Heroku with SSH Keys
update the heroku-cli with the following command:
```
wget -qO- https://cli-assets.heroku.com/install-ubuntu.sh | sh
heroku login
heroku keys:add
```

## Configure Github with SSH Keys
```
curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/kenmazaika/fa8ea7dfbae413638cfd111b974bc74a/raw/ecb5e91c044d92389d0cfd3c2229e57187384d6d/github_auth.rb  > ~/.firehose-github.rb && ruby ~/.firehose-github.rb
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

## Test
```
cd /vagrant/src/curriculum
rails s -b 0.0.0.0 -p 3000
```

## Clone this repository
```
git clone git@github.com:clarkngo/curriculum.git
```

## Navigate to the Rails application

```
$ cd curriculum
```

## Create, migrate and seed the database

 ```
 $ rails db:create
 $ rails db:migrate
 $ rake db:seed
 ```

## Starting the local server

```
$ rails server

   or

$ rails s
```

## Production Deployment

  ```
  $ git push heroku master
  $ heroku run rake db:migrate
  ```

# Items in Planning Phase and Requirements Gathering


Requirements (scoping what to do deliver) 


scope creep (when people start adding stuff outside the requirements)

what components needed

workflow diacourses, how to interact with the system

wireframes

high-level description on the project

repo and stuff

functional requirements, use case

high-level architecture (in Readme)

build these architectural pieces = components

database, schema, API, well-defined endpoint

tests, automated testing and manual testing, do both

write documentation, how can someone use the system

publish in GitHub

# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

## Build the App

### Enable your Vagrant Environment

### Create a Rails App with PostgreSQL as database

At your terminal,

```bash
cd/vagrant/src
```

Create and name your app
```
rails new APP_NAME --database=postgresql
```

### Configure YML files

Edit  `database.yml`

After this line: `pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>`

Add this code block:

```
username: postgres
password: password
host: localhost
```

After this line: `database: curriculum_production`

Comment out this code block:

```
# username: APP_NAME
# password: <%= ENV['APP_NAME_DATABASE_PASSWORD'] %>
```

### Creating the database

Navigate to the project's folder

```bash
cd/vagrant/src/APP_NAME
```

Command to create database
```bash
rails db:create
```

### Start the server

Test the rails app

```bash
rails server -b 0.0.0.0 -p 3000
```

## Pipeline

### Setup Git - your local version control

```bash
git init
git add --all
git commit -am "Initial commit"
```

### Setup GitHub - your cloud version control

Go to GitHub.com. Login & click on the green "New repository" button.

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/APP_NAME.git
git push -u origin master
```

### Deploying toÂ Heroku - host your app in the cloud

Deploy app in Heroku

```bash
heroku create APP_NAME-FIRST_NAME-LAST_NAME
git push heroku master
```

See app URL here:

```bash
heroku apps:info
```
